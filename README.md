# Spotify-Rec-Penn-Spark-

### Summary
I love music but sometimes feel like spotify can end up recommending the same songs over and over again. So I created a web app that allows you to input 3-5 songs you like and it will give you similar songs you may enjoy. Its a fun way to discover new music and broaden your horizons.



### Features
error messages

popular/underground switch
clear button
animations
recommended songs --> spotify button
Integration with Spotify API
Integration Spotify song Database
Fullstack: HTML/CSS + Node.js
Song recommendation algorithm

### Time Spent
I spent a bit over 5 hours on this project, most of the time spent connecting to the Spotify API and perfecting the recommendation algorithm.
